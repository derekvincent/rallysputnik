We have had a ton of progress on the Manchurian and he is almost ready!!!  Sadly that is not the case&#8230; life has been busy and the car has not been touched since the last update 🙁

That is all about to change we have started making phone calls, sending emails, making lists, and collecting parts&#8230; Last night we were at the shop and got him on the scale 3133.4 lbs (weighted about 60% to the front &#8211; they call them lawn darts for a reason!) . While it was in the air we put on some of the newly collected parts&#8230;

We have a plan and some time now&#8230;  need to get the exhaust and clean air sorted  by the end of the year and then over the holidays we start pulling everything apart!!! yea&#8230;
