Hey, is that an Astro Van starter?

No, not that!

Dude, that&#8217;s Top Cat. No, dude, THIS!

Yeah! It&#8217;s totally a starter. You know what we should do? Dude, this&#8217;ll be great. We&#8217;ll, like, put that in and TOTALLY REPLACE the old one! That&#8217;ll surprise whatever old man owns this piece of crap brown van thing. It will be absolutely worth the $80 taxes in to see dude&#8217;s face when his van starts properly! Yeah!

And if buddy has a Lada we should go up to the shop and grid the SNOT out of it.

Oh, and prep the front skid plate, and finish swapping the rear brakes in.

Stupid old van owners.
