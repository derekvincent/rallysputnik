A little bit of news since Tall Pines in November&#8230; After the event we surveyed the damage and found the rear suspension is in dire need of a rebuild, also we seemed to have bent the rear sub-frame on the right side as well as made a mess of the stub axel, and bearings. This was all the cause of our DNF.

We did not think we would be able to get everything fixed and ready for Perce Neige this year so we decided to skip the event this year and plan on Lanark Highlands in May being the first event of our season.

The rear suspension is back from Hot Bits and is refreshed with some new bottom mounts that will make them easier to go in.

Also we have secured some indoor storage and shop space with a couple other rally guys. This should make working on the car easier.
