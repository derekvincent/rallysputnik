The Manchurian is finally out of the driveway and in its new home for the next couple months. Here we will turn it from a mild mannered North American (incognito) street car to a mild mannered rally car. Ready to whisk us through Canadian corners or fling us into all manner of slightly immovable objects at a moments notice.

Stay tuned for build updates staring in a couple weeks.
