  RallySputnik in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.gracklecoffee.com/" target="_blank">Grackle Coffee Company</a> and the <a href="http://www.mlrc.ca" target="_blank">Maple Leaf Rally Club</a> are presenting a Cars & Coffee. Parking for your cars (or bikes) will be in the Raycor parking lot directly across from the Grackle.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <!--more-->We all know everyone will secretly judge what you bring but do not let that stop you.&nbsp;We will have the rally car for everyone to ogle and maybe a Jeep if it breaks down in the lot (again) and we can not move it beforehand. Come have a coffee and hangout with your fellow gear heads.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  No charge for those who want to come but please support the Grackle across the street. If you have any question or are planning to come let us know by get ahold of us in one of the many ways.
</p>
