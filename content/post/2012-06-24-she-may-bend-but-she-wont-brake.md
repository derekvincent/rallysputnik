Yea Yea, we know everyone uses the line but it is true once again&#8230; Either way we spent some time with the Mighty Lada this afternoon after picking up our newest surprise (more on that later)&#8230;

We pulled off a lot of the smashed and bashed parts that are in our way to make our assessment on the damages and it looks like we got really lucky&#8230; their is a fair bit of damage but we feel confident we can be ready for Black Bear in just over 2 weeks&#8230; it might not look pretty but we should be good to go&#8230;

Also as an update on Bryce he is concerned he will be put on probation from the Rally Drivers union since his last two off have been on the drivers side and not on the co-drivers side as per the apparent rules and stipulations of union regulations.

That is all for tonight&#8230;
