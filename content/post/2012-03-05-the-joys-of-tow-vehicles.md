Although sturdy, Astro/Safari vans just **suck** to work on. Change spark plugs and wires? THREE hours plus zip-tying a wire the the body and they still need double-checking. Water pump? Oh buddy, take a seat and let me tell you about **that** little beauty. Four hours, on a brand new vehicle, maybe. Took us&#8230;well, longer than that at any rate. Oh, and &#8211; **and**&#8211; then the rear heater core lines, which had apparently been leaking a little bit are now, thanks to the fully functional heater core, are now peeing car juice. Methinks the rear heater functionality is going the way of the AC &#8211; exists on the dial but not so much in terms of actually doing anything. Oh well &#8211; the spare tires won&#8217;t have climate control options. At least they still have their own stereo controls. Did we mention it was $500?

Next steps: build kludge for leaking heater lines, take wheels off to check spark plugs &#8211; seriously &#8211; and then try to get it down for drive clean to see what fresh hell that brings. 

When do we get to work on the race car?!
