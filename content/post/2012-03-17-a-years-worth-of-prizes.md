We went to the RallySport Ontario AGO today in Peterborough. It was crazy foggy (see picture for example of crazy fog).

While there we got both a used radiator from a wrecker &#8211; for half the price that the wrecker here wanted &#8211; **and** an award! See below for picture of said award. 

Radiator not pictured. I know, that was the bit you were REALLY interested in.
