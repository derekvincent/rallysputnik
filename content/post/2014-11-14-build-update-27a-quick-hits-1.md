As we are into the crunch this is more of a Twitter feed type update but rather than put it on Twitter it&#8217;s going here&#8230;although we really should put something on the damn Twitter feed. @rallysputnik

<!--more-->Here&#8217;s what we got done so far this week:

  * Installed wiper arms, transmission, blade and motor. And they work! This was probably the highlight of the week &#8211; until you&#8217;ve had a wiper problem you&#8217;ve probably never thought about them, but they&#8217;re complex, fragile and hard to find for 23 year old cars.
  * Got quote for insurance. Ouch.
  * Put both doors on and hooked up power (power windows even work! Both sides!)
  * Cut template for door card so we can cut up the last piece of HDPE and make inner door liners
  * Put both fenders on (we would say permanently but really, what rally car has permanent fenders?)
  * Put HDPE fender liner in (drivers side; co-drivers side still to be attached)
  * Put new unsealed headlights in and adapt wiring to make them work
  * Put marker lights in
  * Attached triangles
  * Mounted fire extinguisher (second one still to go in)
  * Figured out location for tool box and jack so we can still fit 2 spare tires and get to fuel pump
  * Wired rally light bar at front and pigtailed into cabin
  * Made a big mess in our shop space

Some pictures are below and we have a bunch of people coming Saturday so we can make some more progress, as the list is still pretty long. Guess we&#8217;d better not be too hung over&#8230; What does that Caswell guy say &#8211; Race Build Party? As long as we keep it in that order we should be fine.
