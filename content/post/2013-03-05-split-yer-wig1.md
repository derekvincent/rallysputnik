Yes, we got somewhere. We got the exhaust catted (thanks Andrew) and we installed it (thanks TCS for having bolts). After that we just had to get insurance and a temporary sticker so we could drive it enough to get a clean air. How hard could that be?

(Cue ominous music&#8230;)

The plans were set and the call was made to insure this bad boy. Price had already been quoted. All set. Except&#8230;
  
Them: We just need pictures of it because it&#8217;s been sitting since you bought it. All four sides and the roof.
  
Me: What difference does it make if it&#8217;s been sitting?
  
Them: I don&#8217;t know but the computer says we need them. So, when you have them, email them to us.
  
Me: Listen, it&#8217;s 30 minutes away and I wanted to do this today. Are you sure you need them?
  
Them: Sorry, the computer is saying we do.
  
Me: This sucks.

It&#8217;s official, we now work for computers instead of the other way around. They always said it would happen&#8230;

So pictures were taken, which involved a 30 minute drive and pushing a reasonably heavy car with very sticky brakes, so I jumped it to move it backwards and video&#8217;d it starting just to prove it does.

(Did you see that interior? Pretty sweet, huh?)

So with all that done, pictures were sent and follow-up call made. Go through the process. Then:
  
Them: Everything sounds good. And you have a safety?
  
Me: Yes.
  
Them: What&#8217;s the number of the safety? And when was it performed?
  
Me: (Thinking the number means I can&#8217;t just say whatever will make this go faster) Ummm, November 2012 &#8211; it&#8217;s registered fit
  
Them: Well, we need one in the last 36 days
  
Me: Oh for the love of Pete. Why?
  
Them: The computer says so
  
Me: But WHY? It&#8217;s good enough for the ministry. This makes no sense if you think about it. Why would you care?
  
Them: Well, it&#8217;s been sitting.
  
Me: And?
  
Them: Well, it&#8217;s in our agreement with (insert insurance company rubbish here that went for a good 5 minutes but meant nothing as far as I could tell) so we have to.
  
Me: That&#8217;s stupid. I&#8217;ll call someone else.
  
Them: Sorry sir, that&#8217;s what the computer says we need.

Yeah, that. So we went with another, slightly more expensive but far less annoying option. And then it was insured!

(Next update: more progress!).
